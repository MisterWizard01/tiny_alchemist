Master:
Apprentice? Apprentice!?
Where are you?

Apprentice:
Right here, master!

Master:
Ah, there you are.

Master:
As you know, today I am leaving.

Apprentice:
L-leaving?

Master:
Yes, for my Wsuper secretW
trip.

Apprentice:
Your t-trip?

Master:
The one I've been planning
for weeks...? Never mind.

Master:
Apprentice, you will be left
to run the alchemy shop all
on your own. 

Apprentice:
A-all on my own?

Master:
One would think I'd hired a
parrot rather than a gifted
youngster.

Master:
All you've done thus far is
repeat me!

Apprentice:
Sorry, Master.

Master:
Never mind, child.

Master:
Do you need a refresher on
how to run the shop?
[yes/no]

Master:
Very well.

Master:
First, we must wait until
the shop magically opens
at 8:00 each morning.

Master:
You can see the current time
in the top right of the
screen...

Master:
And you check whether the
shop is open or closed at the
top left of the lab.

Master:
Before opening and after
closing are good times to
reorganize, if necessary.

Master:
Customers will arrive outside
between 8:00 and 20:00.

Master:
Walk to the counter on the
left edge of the lab to
see the customers lined up.

Master:
The first customer in line
will make an offer in each
of the 3 counter slots.

Master:
If a slot has a potion in it,
the customer wishes to sell
you that potion.

Master:
If the slot is empty, the
customer wishes to buy a
particular potion from you.

Master:
The price of each offer is
listed below the slot.

Master:
Face the uppermost slot
to see what this customer
wishes to buy.

Master:
The formula for the desired
potion will appear. Record
it, mentally or physically.

Master:
Next, do the same for the
potion in the next slot down.

Master:
We're in luck!
